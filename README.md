This is an aur package for `LogicReinc.BlendFarm`

This package provides the client and the server in separate packages.

This project right now works on a forked version of the LogicReinc.BlendRepo, as that one doesn't want to run on some linux distros due to a strange nuget dependency.

To install it, run `makepkg -si`
